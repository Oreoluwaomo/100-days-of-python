# 💰 Day 2 – Tip Calculator

## 📝 Project Description
On Day 2 of my **100 Days of Python** challenge, I built a **Tip Calculator**!  
This program helps you split a restaurant bill easily — including the tip — and tells you exactly how much each person should pay.  

It was a simple but useful project that made me feel like I was already solving real-life problems with Python 😄

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Working with **numbers** and **floats**
- Performing **arithmetic operations**
- Using **f-strings** for clean output
- Taking **multiple user inputs**

## 💻 Example Output
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: $33.60

## 🚀 Reflection
This project helped me understand how to handle user input and perform calculations using variables.  
It felt amazing to see the final amount display correctly — I’m starting to get more comfortable with Python syntax 💪
