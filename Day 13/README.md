# Day 13 - Debugging: How to Find and Fix Errors in Your Code

## Overview
On Day 13, I focused entirely on **debugging** learning how to identify, understand, and fix errors in Python programs.  
Instead of building a new project, this day was about improving problem solving skills and becoming more comfortable reading and testing code logically.  
Debugging is an essential part of development, and learning it early makes coding more efficient and less frustrating.

## Concepts Learned
- How to identify **syntax**, **logic**, and **runtime** errors  
- Using **print statements** and **breakpoints** to trace issues  
- Understanding **error messages** and Python tracebacks  
- Learning how to use **`while` loops**, **conditionals**, and **indexing** more carefully  
- Practicing **step by step testing** instead of guessing  
- Building a habit of writing **clean, testable code**

---

## Practice Exercises
Throughout the lesson, I worked through several small buggy programs to practice:
- Fixing incorrect **loop conditions**  
- Correcting **off by one errors** in loops  
- Managing **list indices** properly  
- Debugging conditional statements that produced unexpected outcomes  
- Using the **Python Tutor** visualizer and **print debugging** to follow code flow

## Reflection
This day was a big mindset shift  from just writing code to actually *understanding* why code behaves a certain way.  
I learned to slow down and test small pieces of logic instead of jumping straight to solutions.  
Debugging helped me see how powerful observation and reasoning are in programming.

## Summary of What I Learned
- The difference between **syntax**, **runtime**, and **logical** errors  
- How to use **print debugging** and **breakpoints** effectively  
- How to read and interpret **error tracebacks**  
- How to fix **loop** and **conditional** logic errors  
- The importance of **testing code incrementally**  
- How debugging improves confidence and clarity in programming**
