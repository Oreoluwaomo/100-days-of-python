# Day 5 - Password Generator Project

## Overview
On Day 5, I built a Password Generator using Python.  
The project focused on combining random letters, numbers, and symbols to create secure passwords while reinforcing skills in list manipulation and loops.

---

## Concepts Learned
- Creating and managing **lists** in Python  
- Using the **`random`** module (`choice()`, `shuffle()`, `randint()`)  
- Building logic with **for loops** and **range()**  
- Combining and shuffling multiple lists  
- Working with **string concatenation** and **list-to-string conversion**  
- Improving code structure and readability  

---

## Project Description
The program allows the user to specify how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in a password.  
It randomly selects characters from predefined lists, combines them, and shuffles the order to generate a strong password.

Example:
How many letters would you like in your password? 6
How many symbols would you like? 3
How many numbers would you like? 2
Your generated password is: 8@Rf!a2Lp$

## Reflection
This project improved my understanding of how lists and loops work together in Python.  
I learned how to use randomization to make programs more dynamic and how to structure logic step by step.  
It also helped me think about efficiency — generating results based on user input instead of fixed values.

## Summary of What I Learned
- How to create and access list elements  
- The difference between **random selection** and **random shuffling**  
- How to use loops to build and modify lists dynamically  
- How to collect user input and use it to drive program behavior  
- How to combine all these concepts to solve a real-world problem — generating strong, unpredictable passwords
