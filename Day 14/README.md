# Day 14 - Higher or Lower Game Project

## Overview
Day 14 focused on building the **Higher or Lower Game**, a fun Python console game where the player guesses which celebrity, company, or brand has more followers.  
This project was a great way to **practice conditionals, loops, functions, and data handling**, all while reinforcing code structure and logic flow.

## Concepts Learned
- How to use **functions** effectively to organize code  
- Working with **while loops** to keep the game running until the user loses  
- Using **if/else statements** to compare values and make decisions  
- **Importing data** from another file and using it dynamically  
- Managing **game flow**: keeping score, resetting, and displaying results  
- Printing formatted output with **f-strings** for readability  
- Using **random.choice()** to pick items from a list

## Project Description
The **Higher or Lower Game** challenges the player to guess which of two entities has a higher follower count.  

### How It Works
1. Two random accounts (A and B) are displayed with names, descriptions, and countries.  
2. The player guesses who has more followers by typing **‘A’** or **‘B’**.  
3. If correct, the score increases and the game continues with the winner as the next challenger.  
4. If incorrect, the game ends and the final score is shown.

## Code Files
- `main.py` — contains the game logic, comparison, and score tracking  
- `game_data.py` — holds a list of data dictionaries for each celebrity/brand  
- `art.py` — contains ASCII art for the logo and vs symbol

## Reflection
This project helped me see how to **structure larger programs** by dividing them into smaller, reusable components.  
It also showed me how to handle **repetitive game logic** cleanly and how to keep track of scores across multiple rounds.  

By the end, I could confidently combine:
- **Conditionals + Loops + Functions**  
- **Random selection + data imports**  
to create a working, interactive game.

## Summary of What I Learned
- How to compare and process data using conditional logic  
- How to maintain a game loop and update scores  
- How to use modular programming by importing code and data from other files  
- How to design a clear, reusable function-based structure  
- How to make console-based games both functional and readable
