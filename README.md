# 100 Days of Coding Challenge (Python)

## Overview
This repository documents my 100 Days of Coding journey using Python.  
The goal of this challenge is to build consistency, improve problem-solving skills, and develop hands-on projects while learning Python programming.  
I will be using PyCharm as my primary IDE throughout this challenge.

## About the Challenge
The 100 Days of Code challenge is a personal commitment to code for at least one hour every day for 100 consecutive days.  
This project will include lessons, exercises, and small projects completed as part of the process.
