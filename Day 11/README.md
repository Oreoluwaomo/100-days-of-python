# Day 11 - Blackjack Capstone Project

## Overview
On Day 11, I built a **Blackjack Game** — a Python version of the classic card game.  
This project combined all the concepts I’ve learned so far : functions, loops, conditionals, and return values  into a single, interactive program.  
It tested both my problem solving and logical thinking skills.

## Concepts Learned
- **Complex conditionals** and nested `if` statements  
- **Functions with return values** for modular code  
- **Lists** for storing and drawing cards  
- **Loops** for continuous gameplay  
- **Boolean logic** and flags to control the game flow  
- Building structured programs with multiple interacting components  
- Handling **edge cases** (like Blackjack and drawing extra cards)

## Project Description
The game simulates a simplified version of Blackjack between a user and a computer dealer.  
Each player starts with two cards. The user can choose to draw more cards (“hit”) or pass (“stand”), while the dealer automatically draws until reaching a specific score.  

The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.  
An Ace can count as either 1 or 11, depending on which is more favorable to the player.

Example interaction:
Your cards: [10, 7], current score: 17
Computer's first card: 9
Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: y
Your final hand: [10, 7, 2], final score: 19
Computer's final hand: [9, 10], final score: 19
It's a draw

## Reflection
This was one of the most challenging projects so far. It required a lot of **logical thinking** and careful handling of conditions.  
I learned how to break a large problem into smaller, manageable steps and combine everything into a smooth, interactive program.  
It also taught me how to simulate real-world scenarios with randomness and probability.

## Summary of What I Learned
- How to combine **functions, lists, and loops** in a complex project  
- How to manage **game logic** using conditionals  
- How to use **flags and loops** for replayable games  
- How to handle **randomness** with the `random` module  
- How to write code that mimics **real world decision-making**
