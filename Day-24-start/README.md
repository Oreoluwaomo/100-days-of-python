#  Day 24 ‚Äì 100 Days of Code 

## Projects Completed

### 1. Snake Game (Final Version)
- Added a **High Score** feature that saves the highest score even after closing the game.  
- Used **file handling** (`open`, `read`, `write`) to store and update the score in a `.txt` file.  
- Improved the game logic for smoother movement and score tracking.  
- Learned how to persist data using external files.

### 2. Mail Merge Project
- Practiced **reading and writing files** in Python.  
- Automated personalized letter creation by replacing placeholders in a template text file with actual names from a list.  
- Improved understanding of **string manipulation** and **file paths**.

##  Concepts Learned
- File handling with `with open()` context manager  
- Reading, writing, and appending text files  
- String replacement using `.replace()`  
- Managing file paths  
- Data persistence between program runs

## üóìÔ∏è Reflection
Today was a huge step forward!  
Completing the Snake Game with a persistent high score felt rewarding seeing the score save automatically made it feel *real*.  
The Mail Merge project also showed how powerful Python can be for automating everyday tasks.  
Can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next
