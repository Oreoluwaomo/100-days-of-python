# Day 1 - Band Name Generator

## Overview
On Day 1, I built a simple **Band Name Generator** using Python.  
This project introduced me to basic programming concepts such as variables, user input, and string concatenation.

---

## Concepts Learned
- Printing output to the console using `print()`
- Receiving user input with the `input()` function
- Storing data in variables
- Combining strings to form output messages
- Understanding basic Python syntax and indentation

---

## Project Description
The Band Name Generator asks the user for:
1. The name of the city they grew up in  
2. The name of their pet  

It then combines these inputs to generate a potential band name.  

Example:
What's the name of the city you grew up in? Lagos
What's your pet's name? Bella
Your band name could be: Lagos Bella

## Code File
- `main.py`

## Reflection
Day 1 helped me get comfortable with using Python syntax, handling input and output, and running simple scripts in PyCharm.  
It was a good start to understanding how user interaction works in a program.
