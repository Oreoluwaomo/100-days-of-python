#  Day 1 â€“ Band Name Generator

##  Project Description
This was my first project in the **100 Days of Python Challenge**.  
Itâ€™s a simple program that asks the user for:
- The name of their city  
- The name of their pet  

Then combines them to generate a fun **band name**!

---

##  Concepts Practiced
- Using the `input()` function  
- Printing and string concatenation  
- Basic Python syntax and user interaction  

---

##  Example Output
Welcome to the Band Name Generator!
What's the name of the city you grew up in? Lagos
What's your pet's name? Coco
Your band name could be: Lagos Coco

## ðŸš€ Reflection
This project helped me understand how Python takes user input and works with strings.  
It was a great confidence booster to start the journey! ðŸŽ¯
