# Day 9 - Secret Auction Program

## Overview
On Day 9, I built a **Secret Auction Program** using Python.  
This project was all about working with **dictionaries** and **loops** to store and process user data.  
The program allows multiple users to enter their bids secretly, and at the end, it determines the highest bidder.

## Concepts Learned
- Creating and modifying **Python dictionaries**  
- **Nesting** lists and dictionaries  
- Using **loops** to collect and process user input  
- Writing **functions** that work with dictionaries  
- Using **flags** like `should_continue` to control program flow  
- Handling **user interaction** and **data validation**

---

## Project Description
The program asks multiple users for their names and bid amounts.  
After all bids are entered, it determines who placed the highest bid and announces the winner.

Example interaction:
Welcome to the secret auction program.
What is your name?: Florence
What's your bid?: $250
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes

What is your name?: Mary
What's your bid?: $300
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': no

The winner is Mary with a bid of $300.

## Reflection
This project helped me understand how to store and manipulate data using **dictionaries**.  
I learned how to structure user input into key-value pairs and how to loop through dictionaries to find specific values.  
It also strengthened my grasp of **program flow control** and **function-based organization**.

## Summary of What I Learned
- How to create, access, and update **dictionaries**  
- How to **nest** lists and dictionaries for structured data  
- How to use **loops** and **flags** to manage user input flow  
- How to write functions that process dictionary data  
- How to determine a **maximum value** in a collection using logic
