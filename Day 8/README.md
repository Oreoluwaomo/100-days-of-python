# Day 8 - Caesar Cipher Project

## Overview
On Day 8, I built a **Caesar Cipher** program in Python.  
This project focused on how to use **functions with inputs**, **parameters**, and **arguments** to make code reusable and dynamic.  
The Caesar Cipher encrypts and decrypts messages by shifting each letter in the alphabet by a chosen number of positions.

## Concepts Learned
- Defining functions with **parameters**  
- Passing **arguments** into functions  
- Using **positional** and **keyword arguments**  
- Working with **loops** and **string indexing**  
- Handling user input and controlling program flow  
- Managing edge cases (e.g., when a shift goes past 'z')  
- Building modular, maintainable code  

---

## Project Description
The Caesar Cipher program allows the user to choose whether to **encode** or **decode** a message, and by how many letters to shift the alphabet.  

Example interaction:
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt: encode
Type your message: hello
Type the shift number: 5
Here's the encoded result: mjqqt

If the user chooses `decode`, the program shifts in the opposite direction:
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt: decode
Type your message: mjqqt
Type the shift number: 5
Here's the decoded result: hello


The program also handles large shift values and allows repeated runs using loops.

## Reflection
This project deepened my understanding of how functions make code more organized and reusable.  
I learned how to pass data into functions, use parameters effectively, and handle user input dynamically.  
It also introduced me to problem-solving through algorithmic thinking 
translating a concept like “shifting letters” into working logic.

## Summary of What I Learned
- How to define functions with one or more parameters  
- How to pass arguments dynamically based on user input  
- The difference between **parameters** (in function definitions) and **arguments** (in function calls)  
- How to use loops and conditionals together to control a program’s flow  
- How to manage user interactions and repeated runs  
- How to apply mathematical thinking to text-based problems
