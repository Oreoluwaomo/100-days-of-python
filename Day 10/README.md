# Day 10 - Calculator Project

## Overview
On Day 10, I built a **Calculator Program** using Python.  
This project focused on learning how to create functions that **return values**, how to use **docstrings**, and how to **reuse functions** effectively.  
It was also my first introduction to **recursion**, allowing the calculator to restart itself for new calculations without restarting the program manually.

## Concepts Learned
- **Functions with return values**  
- Writing and understanding **docstrings**  
- Using **dictionaries** to store operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
- Implementing **loops** and **recursion** for program flow  
- Combining multiple functions to create a reusable tool  
- Handling user inputs dynamically

## Project Description
The Calculator program performs basic arithmetic operations : addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
Users can perform a calculation, then choose to continue with the result or start a new one.

Example interaction:
What's the first number?: 8
+

/
Pick an operation: *
What's the next number?: 4
8 * 4 = 32

Type 'y' to continue calculating with 32, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: y
Pick an operation: +
What's the next number?: 2
32 + 2 = 34


The program continues until the user decides to exit.

## Code Files
- `main.py`
- `art.py` (for the calculator logo)

## Reflection
This project taught me how to **break down logic into smaller functions** and have them work together smoothly.  
I also understood how to manage program repetition using **recursion**  an elegant alternative to loops in certain cases.  
It was satisfying to see how multiple small pieces of code can combine to create a working calculator.

## Summary of What I Learned
- How to write **functions that return outputs**  
- How to use **docstrings** for documentation  
- How to **store and call functions** dynamically using dictionaries  
- How to use **recursion** to restart a program efficiently  
- How to create modular, maintainable code
