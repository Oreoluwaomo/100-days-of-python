# üß† Day 17 ‚Äì Quiz Game (100 Days of Code)

### üìò Project Overview
Day 17 focuses on building a **Quiz Game** using **Python classes and objects**.  
I learned how to create multiple classes (`Question` and `QuizBrain`), store data as objects, and use loops and methods to manage program flow.

This project is part of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode) challenge, where I code daily to strengthen my programming skills.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
- Loads question data from a list of dictionaries.  
- Asks True/False questions to the user in sequence.  
- Tracks the current question number.  
- Allows continuous play until no questions remain.
